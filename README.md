  The very beginning version of this game is written by javascript, you can click the link if you are interested in it although it is 
an unfinished version : https://github.com/Spadille/HumanOptimizationProject .

  Professor Casper and I disscussed to move it from javascript to unity is due to the reason that functionalities are growing out of control during the development of the our project.
